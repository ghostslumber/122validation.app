Explanation
State Management:

The email state holds the value entered in the TextField.
The errorMessage state holds the error message to display if validation fails.
TextField:

The TextField widget is used to get the user's email input.
The isError parameter changes the border color to red if there's an error.
Validation Logic:

The isValidEmail function uses a regular expression to validate the email format.
The validateEmail function checks if the input is valid or if it needs error feedback (e.g., empty field, invalid format).
Error Feedback:

If validation fails (e.g., invalid email or empty field), an error message is displayed below the TextField.
Submit Button:

1. Custom Validation Logic
Implement custom validation rules (e.g., minimum character length, specific formats like email or phone numbers).
Provide real-time feedback to the user as they type.

3. Dynamic Error Messages
Display error messages dynamically below the input field (e.g., "Password must include a special character").
Use animations for showing/hiding error messages to enhance the user experience.

5. Input Transformation
Implement input transformations, such as masking sensitive data (e.g., passwords) or auto-formatting numbers (e.g., phone numbers: 123-456-7890).

7. Debounced Input Validation
Avoid validating every keystroke by implementing a debounce mechanism to validate only after the user pauses typing.

9. Multifield Validation
Validate fields that depend on each other (e.g., password and confirm password matching).

Use Compose's Modifier to customize the look and feel of text fields (e.g., rounded corners, custom colors, or shadows).

Add content descriptions and accessibility labels to ensure compatibility with screen readers.
Support for dynamic font scaling for visually impaired users.

Customize keyboard actions (e.g., Next, Done) and implement appropriate actions for each (like moving to the next field or submitting the form).

Manage focus between input fields seamlessly, with auto-focus shifting when users complete a field.

Show a live character or word counter below the input field (useful for fields with limits, like social media posts).
